# Entropy-Functional-Optimization
Minimize entropy functionals


These Maple worksheets may be used to minimize entropy functionals. Four different strategies are used:

    1. Newton's method solvers are found in each folder.

    The "Proximal Averages..." folder also contains solvers based on the following strategies:

    2. Gradient descent for maximizing a dual problem
    3. Gradient descent for minimizing a squared primal objective function
    4. A homotopy-type method that solves a sequence of problems


The four folders contain the scripts to generate the examples from the four articles:

    1. Scott B. Lindstrom, "A Note on Cores and Quasi Relative Interiors in Partially Finite Convex Programming," 
    Journal of Convex Analysis, in press (2020).
